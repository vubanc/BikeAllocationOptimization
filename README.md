# BikeAllocationOptimization
In this project, a linear programming model has been formulated to find the optimal allocation of 80 bikes among 8 different bike stations in Fort Smith, Arkansas. The model was formulated and solved for two cases:
- For a basic scenario where trip rates were generated assuming constant bike availability (5 bikes available at each station at all times)
- For 50 hypothetical scenarios where trip rates were generated assuming varying bike availability (the availability of bikes is normally distributed) with Monte Carlo Simulation.

The project used data from an actual bikesharing program in the state of Arkansas and the results were presented to the stakeholders of the program. The project is meant to aid a data-driven expansion plan (expanding the number of bikes from 40 to 80 bikes) for the bikesharing program.
