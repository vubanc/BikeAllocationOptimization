# BikeAllocationOptimization
In this project, a linear programming model has been formulated to find the optimal allocation of 80 bikes among 8 different bike stations in Fort Smith, Arkansas. The model was formulated and solved for two cases:
- For a basic scenario with trip rates assuming constant bike availability (5 bikes available at each station at all times)
- For 50 hypothetical scenarios assuming variable bike availability (the availability of bikes is normally distributed) with Monte Carlo Simulation.
The project used data from an actual bikesharing program in the state of Arkansas and the results were presented to the stakeholders of the program to aid data-driven decision making.
